# COVID-19 Poisson Model Project

This project is to study the factors of the spread of n-COVID 2019 virus in the US. We are modeling the incident rate of n-COVID cases with daily county level data.

## Getting Started

### Data Source

For a complete list of data sources, please visit the [Data Source Wiki](https://github.com/Monica0905/COVID2019-GLM-Model/wiki/Data-Source-Wiki) page.

### Access Data

Raw data are stored on Google Drive. Please use [**THIS LINK**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xZDBQJFxCApj7UhAkjtrmrHnOwtgRvye?usp=sharing) to access.

For new data files, please upload directly onto the sharing folder. After uploading, please create a **README** file using either [Text File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file) or [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formats. In the README document, please add a **simple description** of the data included in the folder, along with some of (or the entire of) the following contents:

- Variable lists. This should be served as a quick codebook for reference. [Best practice](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/technical-documentation/codebooks.html)

- Basic descriptive analysis.

- Features or key points.

- Caveats.

### Coding Style

Please refer to [the tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) recommended by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/).

## Descriptive Analysis

A descriptive analysis of county-level confirmed cases in the United States can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Monica0905/COVID2019-GLM-Model/blob/master/reports/descriptive-analysis-county-level-cases-usa-facts.pdf).

## Results

Results are available [HERE](https://github.com/Monica0905/COVID2019-GLM-Model/tree/master/results).
